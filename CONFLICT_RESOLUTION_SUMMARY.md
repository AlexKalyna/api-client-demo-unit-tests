# Git Conflict Resolution Summary

## What We Did

1. **Identified the conflict** in `src/utils/circuit-breaker.ts` using `git status`
2. **Located the conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the import section
3. **Chose the better version** (incoming branch with cleaner formatting)
4. **Removed conflict markers** and kept the desired code
5. **Staged the resolved file** with `git add`
6. **Continued the rebase** with `git rebase --continue`
7. **Force pushed** the rebased branch with `--force-with-lease`

## The Specific Conflict

- **HEAD (your branch)**: Had a comment and different formatting
- **Incoming branch**: Had cleaner formatting with trailing comma
- **Resolution**: Kept the incoming version for consistency

## Rebase vs Merge: Key Differences

### Rebase (What We Did)

```
Before:     A---B---C (main)
            \
             D---E---F (feature)

After:      A---B---C---D'---E'---F' (feature)
```

**How it works:**
- **Replays** your commits on top of the target branch
- **Rewrites history** - creates new commit hashes
- **Creates linear history** - no merge commits
- **Requires force push** after rebasing

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clean, linear history
- ✅ No merge commits cluttering the log
- ✅ Easier to follow the project timeline
- ✅ Better for feature branches

**Cons:**
- ❌ Rewrites commit history (changes hashes)
- ❌ Can be confusing for beginners
- ❌ Requires force push
- ❌ Loses the original context of when commits were made

### Merge (Alternative Approach)

```
Before:     A---B---C (main)
            \
             D---E---F (feature)

After:      A---B---C-------G (main)
            \             /
             D---E---F---/ (feature)
```

**How it works:**
- **Preserves** original commit history
- **Creates a merge commit** that combines both branches
- **Keeps original commit hashes** unchanged
- **Regular push** works fine

**Pros:**
- ✅ Preserves exact history
- ✅ No force push needed
- ✅ Clear indication of when branches were merged
- ✅ Safer for shared branches

**Cons:**
- ❌ Creates merge commits
- ❌ Can create messy, non-linear history
- ❌ Harder to follow the project timeline
- ❌ More cluttered git log

## Why We Chose Rebase

1. **Clean History**: Your demo project will have a linear, easy-to-follow commit history
2. **Professional Practice**: Many teams prefer rebase for feature branches
3. **Learning Experience**: You practiced a more advanced Git technique
4. **Solo Development**: Since you're the only developer, force push is safe

## When to Use Each

**Use Rebase when:**
- Working on feature branches
- You want clean, linear history
- You're the only one working on the branch
- Preparing for a pull request

**Use Merge when:**
- Working on shared branches
- You want to preserve exact timing
- You're not comfortable with force push
- You need to maintain the original context

The rebase approach gave you a much cleaner project history for your demo!
